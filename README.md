# Resume-Portfolio
This is my personal Resume-Portfolio website, designed to showcase my skills, projects, and achievements in the field of computer science and web development.
It serves as a digital resume, giving visitors an overview of my technical expertise and creative work.
The portfolio highlights my journey as a B.Tech Computer Science student at Bangalore Institute of Technology (2022â€“2026).
I have focused on building responsive, user-friendly, and visually appealing web applications.
The website is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring a smooth and interactive browsing experience.
It also reflects my ability to work with MySQL and MongoDB for efficient data handling.
My goal is to create solutions that are both functional and aesthetically pleasing.
